        <h2>Top Five Citie In The World</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Tokyo, Japan
        Highlighted rankings: Restaurants (1), Global 500 (2)
        
        Why we love it: “Despite the pandemic and subsequent derailment of Japan’s plans—or perhaps because of them—the Japanese government remains steadfast, keeping its target of 60 million visitors and $136 billion in tourism revenue by 2030. It’s not as delusional as it sounds: the country enjoyed record tourism for seven straight years and can now accommodate even more visitors to Tokyo, with the expansion of the international terminal at Haneda, the city’s main airport,” says Resonance. 
        
        Ranked no. 1 for its restaurants, Tokyo is home to some life-changing ramen, making it a destination worth planning an entire trip around food. And if most of your travel budget goes to eating, don’t worry. There are plenty of affordable hotels in Tokyo to book</p>
        <p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates
        Highlighted rankings: Safety (1), Foreign-Born Population (1)
        
        Why we love it: You may associate Dubai with its record-setting skyscrapers and that reputation is well earned, but “the Burj Khalifa’s time in the sun may be nearing an end,” reports Resonance. “Santiago Calatrava’s Tower at Dubai Creek will eclipse the skyscraper as the tallest building in the world when completed, in 2022 at the earliest. More certain for the city is Expo 2020 (to take place, in fact, in 2021-2022), a multibillion-dollar half-year fair aiming to draw 25 million visits. Nearly 200 nations will be showcased at the pavilions, adorned, like Italy’s 3D-printed David by Michelangelo, with cultural celebrations of the future ahead. Speaking of the future, the city’s sensory overload of a Museum of the Future should also be done later this year, providing more magnetism to a place eager for its post-lockdown.”</p>
        <p>New York City, United States
        Highlighted rankings: Google Trends (1), Culture (2)
        
        Why we love it: “New York City is reawakening, with infrastructure upgrades, a packed cultural calendar, world-class hotels, a new outdoor dining scene, multicultural neighborhoods to explore and many more vibrant offerings on display across all five boroughs this year,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, told Resonance in May. In other words: NYC isn’t dead, folks. 
        
        “The City” consistently ranks for its culture; it came in seventh for museums, which are continually improving as evidenced by the 2019 renovation of the Museum of Modern Art and the Fotografiska photography museum that opened in Manhattan’s Flatiron District. New to the Sights and Landmarks list: suspended arts-and-culture park Little Island in—yes, in—the Hudson River. And as Broadway starts to turn its lights back on this month, we expect visitors will follow.</p>

        <p>Paris, France
            Highlighted rankings: Sights and Landmarks (3), Shopping (3)
            
            Why we love it: As Paris gears up for the 2024 Olympics, it’s only getting better. Improved infrastructure and a handful of new hotels in the past year alone add to a city we love for its world-class art, shopping, and global cuisine. 
            
            “Almost as soon as the pandemic started, Parisians poured out of their close quarters onto the iconic Rue de Rivoli, the famed artery that intersects the heart of the capital, when it became off-limits to cars,” says Resonance. “The Champs-Élysées is next on the city leadership’s list, set to be transformed over the next decade into a massive garden, with vehicle access cut in half and millions of euros invested in pedestrian-focused amenities.”</p>
