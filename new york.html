            <h1>New York</h1>
            <p>Know this about New York</p>
            <p>New York is divided into five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, the Bronx, and the best-known of all, Manhattan. This is where you will find most of the city’s top attractions, such as the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, the Chrysler Building and more. And ferries to the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island depart from Lower Manhattan. And for the best views of Manhattan go to the Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Centre.</p>
            <p>There are lots of options in New York once the sun sets. If you like theatre, you’ve got Broadway. If you want to party, there are bars galore, and one of the coolest places to go out is in Greenwich Village</p>
